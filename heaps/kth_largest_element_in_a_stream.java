// Kth Largest Element in a Stream
// You are part of a university admissions office and need to keep track of the kth highest test score from applicants in real-time. This helps to determine cut-off marks for interviews and admissions dynamically as new applicants submit their scores.

// You are tasked to implement a class which, for a given integer k, maintains a stream of test scores and continuously returns the kth highest test score after a new score has been submitted. More specifically, we are looking for the kth highest score in the sorted list of all scores.

// Implement the KthLargest class:

// KthLargest(int k, int[] nums) Initializes the object with the integer k and the stream of test scores nums.
// int add(int val) Adds a new test score val to the stream and returns the element representing the kth largest element in the pool of test scores so far.

import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class KthLargest {

    PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap;
    int k;

    public KthLargest(int k, int[] nums) {
        minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();
        this.k = k;

        for (int num : nums) {
            add(num);
        }
        System.out.println(minHeap.peek());
    }

    public int add(int val) {
        // Add to our minHeap if we haven't processed k elements yet
        // or if val is greater than the top element (the k-th largest)
        if (minHeap.size() < k || minHeap.peek() < val) {
            minHeap.add(val);
            if (minHeap.size() > k) {
                minHeap.remove();
            }
        }
        return minHeap.peek();
    }
}

 * Your KthLargest object will be instantiated and called as such:
